# Microphone arrays and beamforming


Melania Moras


the interface appears when you run the file main.py

the steps for using the application are:

placing the 4 voices in the room by simply clicking within the yellow circle

"esegui beamforming" does the delay-and-sum beamforming

"recorded signal" plays the signal as if it was recorded by one microphone only

"beamformed signal" plays the beamformed signal

"reset" deletes the current placement of the voices


the radiation pattern can be modified by adjusting the parameters at the top of the interface, and the dashed line shows the direction of the main lobe.
